7. Kubernetes Security and Automation Framework
Objective: Develop a comprehensive security and automation framework for Kubernetes clusters.

Scope:

Security Policies: Enforce network policies, pod security policies, and RBAC.
Security Automation: Automate security tasks like IAM management and security audits (OPA, Calico, AWS Lambda).
IaC Security: Create a tool to analyze Infrastructure as Code scripts for security vulnerabilities (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Checkov).
Scale:

Manage security for thousands of Kubernetes nodes.
Continuous security audits and enforcement of policies.
Automate security for large-scale, multi-cluster environments.
Business Justification/Impact:

Security Posture: Enhance security posture for Kubernetes deployments.
Operational Efficiency: Reduce manual effort through automation.
Compliance: Ensure compliance with Kubernetes security best practices.
Tools: Python, Kubernetes, OPA, Calico, AWS Lambda, Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Checkov.
